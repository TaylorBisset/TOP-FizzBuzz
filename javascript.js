// Javascript.js TOP-FizzBuzz

/*
Write a program that takes a userâ€™s input and prints the numbers 
from one to the number the user entered. 
However, for multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number 
and for the multiples of five print Buzz. 
For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz.

/* 
When a user inputs a number
Loop from 1 to the entered number
If the current number is divisible by 3 then print "Fizz"
If the current number is divisible by 5 then print "Buzz"
If the current number is divisible by 3 and 5 then print "FizzBuzz"
Otherwise print the current number
